_The successful implementation of a predictive model for student performance in online courses has significant implications for both educators and students. Educators can proactively address issues that hinder student success, thereby improving overall course effectiveness. For students, early intervention ensures a better learning experience and increased chances of academic success in online courses. This research focuses on students enrolled in online courses within a specified educational  institution or platform. The study aims to analyze a diverse set of variables including total classes and attended classes and assessment grades._
